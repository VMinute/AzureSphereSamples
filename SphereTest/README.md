This solution includes a simple library to control PWM (SoftPWM folder), a sample that drives GPIO0 pin with different frequencies and duty cycles (PWMTest).
PWM is then used to control servo motors using a lib (Servo) and showing a small sample moving a servo across its full rotation angle (ServoTest).  
To run this sample you can connect the servo VCC and ground to the 5V and GND pins of the MT3620 EVB and the driving pin to GPIO0.
